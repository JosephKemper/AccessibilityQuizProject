## Steps 1 through 26
As I write my first entry into the deep dive portion of my accessibility project, I am a little more than a third of the way done with the project. The reason I delayed in writing anything is because I was processing everything and trying to put words to what I was learning. I just completed step 26 out of 67 and in that step, the goal was to create a CSS selector that would hide text from view that was given a specific class. Before I got halfway through the step, the text I was supposed to be hiding was already hidden, and with the rest of the step, I was either not sure what it was doing or it looked like it was going to be just duplicating what we had already done. So, I took that chance to do a deep dive, and it was all about catching edge cases and supporting a more diverse set of browsers. Now, as I sit here thinking about everything I saw in the previous 25 steps, I see the same pattern. Properly supporting accessibility is an application of programming mastery. You have to think about and prepare for the edge cases and even legacy systems. That is something that any programmer would do well to learn, for if you are only thinking so far as to get it working on your computer, then you are only programming for yourself, and that will leave you lacking in the skills department, and thus struggling to get or keep a job.
